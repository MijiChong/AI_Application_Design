Fisherman**\n","\n","A soft breeze wafted through the salty air as the sun began its daily ritual of rising over the horizon. Byron, an old man with a weathered face, stood at the edge of the rocky pier, surveying the sea before him. The townspeople often shared tales of Byron, the last of the fishermen, who had fished these waters since he was a boy. His stories were woven with legends of mermaids and whales that sang songs of ancient times.\n","\n","Though his hands trembled slightly from age, there was still a spark in Byron’s steely blue eyes. He always wore a faded blue cap emblazoned with the name of the boat he once captained, \"The Wild Horizon.\" For years, he pursued the bounty of the sea, but as modern technology transformed the world, he found himself standing almost alone, mourning the changes that had swept through his beloved fishing village. While the others abandoned their boats for the large trawlers, he remained, a solitary figure amidst a world ignoring the ocean’s whisper.\n","\n","Every morning, he would take his tiny dinghy out into the open water, where he believed the sea still held secrets waiting to be unveiled. Byron cherished the simple days of old, when he could hear the stories whispered by the waves. He spoke to them as if they could understand, and he often thought of the catch he had missed – the fish that were there just out of reach, never to be caught, yet always lingering.\n","\n","One such morning, amidst the fog that clung to the water’s surface, Byron cast his net far and wide. As the sun broke through the gray shroud, illuminating the icy blue sea, he felt a tug – not the usual resistance of a fish, but something else altogether. Intrigued, he pulled harder, expecting a sizable catch. Instead, he heaved up a small, ornate chest, barnacles clinging to its sides, a treasure of the sea.\n","\n","Byron’s heart raced as he gently pried open the rusty latch. Inside lay a collection of shimmering pearls, glowing as if they held the sun within them. Delighted, he could hardly believe his luck. But as his fingers caressed the smooth, cold pearls, he recalled the stories of the old sailor’s curse: those who spoiled the sea's treasures would be forever bound to the ocean.\n","\n","“Don’t let greed be your downfall,” he murmured, withdrawing his hand. But the pearls were mesmerizing, and in that moment, he felt a deep longing to take them back to the shore, to be the victor in this tale.\n","\n","Yet, as he turned the chest around in his hands, a splash erupted from beneath the surface. Byron gasped, watching a dark shape breach the water. It was a dolphin – or perhaps something much larger. The creature twirled and spun, as if warning him to relinquish the pearls.\n","\n","Conflicted between temptation and reverence, Byron hesitated, and for a fraction of a moment, time seemed to still. He could hear the whispers of the waves urging him away, begging him to leave the chest behind. But greed, as familiar a companion as the sea itself, pushed him onward.\n","\n","With a heavy heart and a fleeting thought of abandoning them, he chose instead to take a single pearl, the largest and most exquisite one, as a memento of this rare fortune. As soon as he pocketed it, the layers of fog thickened, enveloping him, and there was an eerie silence as the world faded away.\n","\n","Moments turned to an eternity as he floated on the water, lost. Suddenly, the water around him began to pulse. The ocean roared, and Byron felt his dinghy rise and fall as if on a stormy current, despite the gentle weather. Then, in an explosive rush, he was thrown into the depths of the sea.\n","\n","It was dark. The silence was breathtaking, and for a moment, he felt utterly at peace. He surrendered to the embrace of the ocean, the water around him swirling with glittering currents. And there, in this sunless abyss, he saw them—the lost sailors, the lost fishermen, and fish with human-like faces. They all glanced at him knowingly, their gaze offering companionship.\n","\n","As he floated among them, Byron realized that he was home. No longer just a fisherman, he became one with the stories he once told. The sea had claimed him, but he was not afraid. The town would never know, but Byron had become part of the ocean’s tapestry—a legend of the deep.\n","\n","The twist was this: all those years, he thought he was the last fisherman. But the truly remarkable truth was that Byron had always been meant to stay with the sea, becoming its eternal guardian, the very essence of the stories whispered in the wind.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#cover art\n","from IPython.display import Image\n","\n","\n","def art_gen(prompt):\n","  response = client.images.generate(\n","      model = 'dall-e-2',\n","      prompt = prompt,\n","      size = '256x256',\n","      n=1\n","  )\n","\n","  return response.data[0].url"],"metadata":{"id":"H4HrxiPSYshc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728965912814,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":446,"user":{"displayName":"CHONG MICHI","userId":"01838637233865838673"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# cover prompt design\n","def design_gen(prompt):\n","  system_prompt = \"\"\"\n","  You will be given a short story.

Focus on an old man with flowing silver hair—Elias—standing steadfast on the shore, gazing intently at the luminous sea. His weathered logbook clutched in one hand spills glowing sketches and indecipherable script, blurring into the waves as if merging with their secrets. In his other hand, there's a glimmering seashell close to Lila, a young girl, standing awed beside him, a curiosity shining in her eyes. The ocean behind them should unexpectedly shimmer with ethereal images swirling in the water, hinting at the hidden treasures of memories and dreams they share. Capture the magic, beauty, and poignancy of their bond to the sea and the treasures it holds, without entirely revealing what those secrets are.\n","**Title: The Old Man and the Sea of Secrets**\n","\n","The village of Eldermere sat at the edge of the world, where the ocean kissed the sky. While the other villagers busied themselves with daily chores, the old man known only as Elias spent hours staring out at the horizon, his silver hair whipped by the salty breeze. The townsfolk whispered tales about him, claiming he’d once been a renowned sailor, exploring distant lands, but now he seemed to be just a relic of time, a ghost who conversed with the waves.\n","\n","Every morning, Elias would walk to the shore, clutching a weathered logbook filled with sketches and notes, all of which were written in an indecipherable script. The villagers thought the old man was mad, wasting away his days talking to the water and scribbling nonsense, yet Elias was undeterred. In his heart, he believed the sea held secrets far greater than the trivial worries of the villagers.\n","\n","It was on one of these serene mornings, as the golden sun broke over the horizon, that a young girl named Lila approached him. She was drawn to the old man, not just because of his quirky habits, but because she felt there was a story waiting to be uncovered. Lila, who often felt overlooked and misunderstood, saw in Elias a kindred spirit. \n","\n","“Why do you talk to the sea?” she asked one bright day, curiosity lighting her eyes.\n","\n","Elias turned, his deep blue eyes more vibrant than the ocean itself. “Because the sea speaks back, child. It has stories to tell, if only you know how to listen.”\n","\n","Intrigued, Lila asked if she could join him on his daily ritual. From then on, every morning, they would walk to the shore together. Elias would recount tales of mythical creatures, storms that could uproot mountains, and adventures that defied imagination. In return, Lila would share her dreams—of flying and exploring, of friendships that felt true yet were fleeting.\n","\n","One fateful day, while they were collecting seashells, Lila stumbled upon an old bottle sealed tight. Inside, a tattered piece of parchment caught her eye. “Elias! Look!” she exclaimed, holding the bottle aloft.\n","\n","With careful hands, Elias pried the bottle open and drew out the fragile note. As he read aloud, the ink began to shimmer, revealing a map that charted a course deep into the ocean. “This is a treasure map,” he mumbled, but a shadow crossed his face. “It’s not about gold or jewels, Lila. This is a map to the heart of the sea.”\n","\n","“Can we find it?” Lila’s voice was charged with excitement.\n","\n","Elias hesitated. The treasure the map led to was not material. It was a place where dreams became real, and memories surfaced like dead fish washed ashore. He’d been searching all his life to return there, a place of lost but cherished moments.\n","\n","That evening, Elias decided to take Lila to the deepest part of the shoreline where the waves roared and the water swirled like a living entity. He led her to a secret cove hidden by jagged rocks. “This is the place,” he said, “but I need your help to call forth the treasures of the sea.”\n","\n","As Lila stood on the edge, she felt a surge of energy radiating from the ocean. She closed her eyes and began to whisper her dreams, the stories she held in her heart. Old Elias joined her, his voice harmonizing with hers. They called upon memories, forgotten hopes, and whispers of the past.\n","\n","Suddenly, the water began to glow. Luminescent waves surged around them, and in a flash, images began to form—visions of young sailors laughing under the sun, families enjoying picnics on beaches, and children chasing after crabs. Lila gasped as the memories swirled around them, and she realized these weren’t just dreams; these were the echoes of the villagers, their lost joys reaching out from the depths of the sea.\n","\n","“Look!” Lila shouted, pointing as figures began to materialize—ghostly apparitions of the villagers, reliving their happiest moments, all connected through the sea.\n","\n","But just as they reached out to touch the shimmering forms, the tide shifted. A tidal wave formed, pulling the visions back into the water. In an instant, the waves swallowed the magic, and the sea returned to its ordinary self.\n","\n","Elias fell to his knees, tears streaming down his weathered cheeks. “I waited too long,” he whispered. “Those memories were mine to preserve, but I had forgotten.”\n","\n","Lila reached for him, wanting to comfort the old man. “It wasn’t just you, Elias. We remembered together.”\n","\n","But as she touched his shoulder, a ripple of realization dawned on her. It felt different, almost like a reflection. Suddenly, she wasn't in the cove anymore. Instead, she stood at the shore as an adult, looking at the waves that now seemed distant. There was no old man beside her; there was only silence.\n","\n","Lila blinked, and in that moment, all the memories she had shared with Elias came flooding back—his stories, their laughter, the dreams they spoke of. But all were memories. She had grown old, beheld by the curse of forgetting the sacredness of dreams.\n","\n","It wasn’t the sea that held the secrets, she realized. The secrets were in the moments shared, the ephemeral connections forged through understanding and hope. And thus, standing shocked on the shore, Lila finally understood the true treasure—after all, the sea was only the keeper of their stories, now hers to tell.\n","\n","But it was then that she saw it—a tattered logbook lying in the sand, the writing familiar. Stepping closer, she flipped it open as she remembered the whisper of the ocean. It began to shimmer, and with every new word, Lila could feel youth and dreams unraveling once more.\n","\n","The waves crashed behind her, beckoning her to listen again—this time not as a child, but as the vessel of their stories. The ocean would never remain silent again.\n"]}]}]}
